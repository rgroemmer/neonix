# NEONIX

This is my favorite everyday editor configuration for neovim.

Currently, it is under construction :construction:
The configuration will offer the following features:

- Standalone usability from anywhere with nix run github:rgroemmer/neonix
- Integration with home-manager as a module, activated through programs.neonix.enable
- Separation of configuration and language-support for modularity and customization according to specific needs
